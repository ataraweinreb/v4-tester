<p style="font-size: 18px;">During my internship with Datadog's Application Performance Monitoring (APM) team, I focused on enhancing the frontend experience for tools that monitor and optimize application performance. APM offers a robust suite including tracing, profiling, metrics, error tracking, platform integrations, alerting, collaboration features, and scalability for cloud-native environments. I contributed to the development of serverless tracing and logs, with a focus on UI enhancements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.</p>
