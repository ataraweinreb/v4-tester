<p style="font-size: 18px;">I currently work on Snapchat's Creator Growth team, where I develop tools for UGC creators to share media across the Stories, Spotlight, and Discover products. My role encompasses both new feature development and platform work aimed at improving test coverage, reliability, and engineering excellence.</p>
