<p style="font-size: 18px;">Scan was a visual search tool in the Snapchat app that helped users explore the world around them. It allowed users to identify dogs, plants, music, and more using their smartphone camera and the power of machine learning.

During my time on the team, I worked as a hybrid iOS engineer and product designer, focusing on tasks like developing iOS features, UX/UI design, prototyping, and collaborating closely with product teams.

I contributed to several feature launches, including web image search, Bitmoji outfit matching, code detection, and AllRecipes food scanning. I also developed functional prototypes for LLM integrations and new live scanning features, exploring advancements in AI and AR technologies.
